# OpenCV-projects-with-Python

> Programming language: Python | Library: OpenCV

Analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images, it's the main propose of the project. 
The Python OpenCV library is mostly preferred for computer vision tasks, and it will be used since the beginning. First, in simple tasks, as detecting all the edges of different objects of the image.

## About the project

The Top 25 Computer Vision Project Ideas for 2020 by Data Flair are a good place to start learning Computer Vision. 
After that, engineering and creativity will meet to create new solutions for real (or simulated) Computer Vision problems.

## Motivation

Learn Computer Vision it's useful for some areas of artificial intelligence, automatic inspection, controlling processes, navigation, and so on. 
Computer Vision it's used in several areas such as Medicine and Military.
